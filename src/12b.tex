\begin{problem}{Bernoulli and Poisson process}
Indicate whether either the Bernoulli or Poisson process is a suitable process to model:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] The time epochs at which search queries are performed at \url{www.google.be}.
\item[(b)] The days of the year during which it rains in Antwerp city
\end{itemize}

\begin{problem}{Bernoulli and Poisson process}
Consider a (RAID) system consisting of 80 hard
disk drives. Assume that the life time of a disk has an exponential distribution with a
mean of 1200 days. If a disk fails it is immediately replaced by another new disk. On
average how many disks need replacement per month? Explain your answer using the
properties of the exponential distribution and the Poisson process.

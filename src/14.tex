\begin{problem}{Poisson Process}
Consider a set of $n$ hard disk drives and assume the lifetime of a drive is exponential with parameter $\mu$. When a disk crashes it is not replaced. How long will it take on average before all of the $n$ disks have crashed?
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
The expectant time (T) for all n disks to fail can be written as follows:
\begin{align*}
    T&= \frac{1}{n\mu }+ \frac{1}{(n-1)\mu} + ... +\frac{1}{\mu}
    \\
    &= \frac{1}{\mu}(\frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{n-1}+ ... +\frac{1}{n})\\
    &= \frac{1}{\mu} \sum _{k=1} ^{n} \frac{1}{k}
\end{align*}
Where we recognize the sum as the $n$-th harmonic number, where for n going to infinity (see Wikipedia) is equal to :
\begin{align*}
    \gamma + \ln{n}
\end{align*}
This gives us:
\begin{align*}
    T= \frac{1}{\mu} (\gamma + \ln{n})
\end{align*}
\end{solution}

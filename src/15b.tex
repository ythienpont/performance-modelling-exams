\begin{problem}{Bernoulli and Poisson process}
Indicate whether the following two processes are Poisson. Explain your answer.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Points in time at which cars pass by on a road if the time between two cars has a uniform distribution with a mean of 27 seconds.
\item[(b)] Points in time at which spam mail arrives in your mailbox.
\end{itemize}
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] This cannot be Poisson since a Poisson process requires the inter-arrival times to follow an exponential distribution and the problem indicates a uniform distribution.
\item[(b)] Assuming the spam emails arrive independently and at a relatively constant rate, then this process could be modelled as an approximate Poisson process. 
\end{itemize}
\end{solution}

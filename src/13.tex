\begin{problem}{Bernoulli and Poisson process}
Indicate whether the Poisson process is a suitable process to model the time epochs at which:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] orders are placed at \url{amazon.com};
    \item[(b)] people buy online tickets for a rock concert;
    \item[(c)] queries arrive at a DNS server;
    \item[(d)] handovers occur in a wireless network.
\end{itemize}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{Bernoulli and Poisson process}
Assume that the time it takes before a new computer gets infected by a virus is exponentially distributed and that about 20\% get infected within the first 6 months. What is the probability that a new computer remains uninfected during the first 3 years (assuming all computers are equally vulnerable)?
\end{problem}
